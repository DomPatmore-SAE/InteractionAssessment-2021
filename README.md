# Instructions-PLEASE READ CAREFULLY! 
**Please be prepared to describe your code. Basically if you don't understand it, don't use it!**

You have been chosen by Whisks and Things (https://whiskandthings.co.uk/) to audit their newly launched website. To do so, you'll need to complete the following:


1. Generate 2 personas for the website. Be as specific as you can with age, genders, financial status, and reasons for coming to the website. (20 points)
   
2. Choose one of the personas and use the 5 second rule. Does the website pass? If so, why? If not, what should the site owner do? (15 points)
   
3. Using the same persona, what 3 things would you as an observer want to check or confirm in a usability test? (15 points)

4. One of the problems with the website is the navigation doesn't help your persona. Create a navigation wireframe in HTML that serves your persona (20 points)

5. The owner wishes to have a bespoke loading icon. Create a purple square in the center of the page, and demonstrate the animation principles of easing and arching. (30 points)
